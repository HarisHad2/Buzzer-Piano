# Buzzer Piano

This project is a Arduino project were I have made a buzzer play a note by the push of a button. 

## Material

 * Arduino Uno
 * Breadbord
 * 4 Jumper Wires
 * 1 Button 
 * 1 Resistor 1k ohm
 * 1 Buzzer
 
## The Code

At the beginning the note you want to be played is set. Then comes naming the componets and which pin is being used. At the void setup the button has been set to behave as an input. The void loop has the code for what happens when the button is pressed. When the button has been pressed the note that has been set starts playing from the buzzer.
